;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an alternative interactive serach interface for
;; mu and mu4e (see URL `https://djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html').
;; It uses a consult-based minibuffer completion for searching and
;; selecting, and marking emails, as well as additional utilities for
;; composing emails and more.

;;  This package requires mu4e version "1.10.8" or later.


;;; Code:
